# evrspin

This R package is an implementation of the theoretical framework presented in Livshits et al in their 2016 Nature Communications publication entitled *Isolation of exosomes by differential centrifugation: Theoretical analysis of a commonly used protocol.*

The evrspin package is intended to help plan exosome and extracellular vesicle purifications by ultracentrifugation. This package allows users to make logical decisions for exosome and microvesicle enrichment, customized to their particular rotor and solvent system.

Currently evrspin is in its first pre-release (v0.1.0). During this time, please keep in mind that evrspin is still in development and may not be ready for production use. I'll be adding a vignette in the near future to demonstrate the types things evrspin can do.

Until full release, to give the evrspin a whirl:
```r
# if you don't already have devtools installed
intall.packages("devtools")

install_github("wfondrie/evrspin")
```

Some things I'm still working on:  
- **Vignettes**
- Revising and adding Documentation
- Bug Hunting
