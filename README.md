# evrspin

This R package is an implementation of the theoretical framework presented in Livshits et al in their Nature Communications publication entitled *Isolation of exosomes by differential centrifugation: Theoretical analysis of a commonly used protocol.*

The evrspin package is intended to help plan exosome and extracellular vesicle purifications by ultracentrifugation.


TODO:  
- work on documentation for cutoff\_d.R, pelleted.R, and sed\_time.R
- Add more unit tests
