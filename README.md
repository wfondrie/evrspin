# evrspin

This R package is an implementation of the theoretical framework presented in Livshits et al in their Nature Communications publication entitled *Isolation of exosomes by differential centrifugation: Theoretical analysis of a commonly used protocol.*

The evrspin package is intended to help plan exosome and extracellular vesicle purifications by ultracentrifugation.
