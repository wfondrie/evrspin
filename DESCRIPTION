Description: everspin is a tool intended to aid users in the planning of
    extracellularvesicle enrichments and purifications by centrifugation. The
    calculations presented by evrspin are an implementation of the theorectical
    framework formulated by Livshits et alin their Nature Communications
    publication, "Isolation of exosomes by differential centrifugation:
    Theoretical analysis of a commonly used protocol"
