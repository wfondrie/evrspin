Description: The evrspin package is a tool intended to aid users in the planning of
    extracellular vesicle enrichments and purifications by centrifugation. The
    calculations presented by evrspin are an implementation of the theorectical
    framework formulated by Livshits et al in their 2016 Nature Communications
    publication titled, "Isolation of exosomes by differential centrifugation:
    Theoretical analysis of a commonly used protocol".
